# 👋 Hi, I'm Souvik!
- :man_technologist: I usually code in Python, develop web-apps using Angular, and hate js, graphs and trees with a passion
- 👀 Projects that interest me are usually tools and servivces that people thought they'd never need until it's out in the market, and now they need it more than anything else
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of network security (I use debian btw), getting into cloud tech and trying to pick up React.js while brushing up on my CC skills 
- 💞️ I'd love collaborate on any interesting open source project that has an interesting use-case
- :bearded_person: I like drinking coffee, discussing about new tech, solving riddles and meeting new people
- 📫 You can connect with me on linkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/souvikmishra/ or you can mail me at mishra.souvik911@gmail.com
